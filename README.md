# FAKE NEWS CLASSIFIER
Fake news which spread across people as fast as the real news could. Fake news is a piece of incorporated or falsified information often aimed at misleading people to a wrong path or damage a person or an entity’s reputation.

Characteristics of Fake News:

Their sources are not genuine.
May or may not have grammatical errors.
Often uses attention-seeking words, click baits, etc.
Seems too good to be true.
Mimics the real headlines and twists the story.
A study shows that a fake tweet on Twitter spreads six times faster than the real one. Thus, it becomes necessary to find whether a piece of news is true or fake whenever we read any information on the web.
As humans, when we read an article, we could somehow understand its context by interpreting its words. Given today’s volume of news, it is possible to teach computers how to read and understand the difference between real and fake news using NLP techniques. All you need here are the appropriate Machine Learning algorithms and a dataset.
